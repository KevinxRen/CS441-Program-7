CS441 - Program 7: Augmented Reality

For this project, I want to explore Apple's ARKit SDK and create a simple and 
fun AR app. 

Apple's ARKit SDK is only compatible with devices running IOS 11 and have the A11, A10, or A9 processors.

The goal is to use display a 3D object in real time with the SKD recognizing the scene using camera, geometrics, and lighting.
